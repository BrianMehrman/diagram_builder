# Story 5.5-6: Documentation Reorganization

## Story

**ID:** 5.5-6
**Key:** 5.5-6-documentation-reorganization
**Title:** Reorganize project documentation as navigation hub
**Epic:** Epic 5.5 - Foundation Cleanup
**Phase:** Foundation & Quality Gates

**Description:**

Reorganize root project documentation files (README.md, PLANNING.md, CLAUDE.md) to serve as clear navigation hubs pointing to detailed documentation in _bmad-output. Add high-level overview to architecture.md for quick LLM orientation.

This addresses the documentation organization issues discovered in Epic 5 retrospective.

## Dev Notes

### Context from Retrospective

**Documentation Organization Issues:**
- Root files don't guide to detailed docs
- _bmad-output structure not documented
- Unclear which documents are source of truth
- Both humans and LLMs struggle to navigate
- architecture.md dives into details without high-level context

### Current State

**Root Files:**
- README.md - Basic stub, minimal content
- PLANNING.md - Exists but doesn't explain _bmad-output
- TASKS.md - Contains phase/epic breakdown
- CLAUDE.md - Has instructions but no doc paths

**_bmad-output Structure:**
- planning-artifacts/ - Contains architecture.md, prd.md
- implementation-artifacts/ - Contains stories, sprint-status.yaml
- No README explaining organization

### Implementation Guidance

**README.md Structure:**
```markdown
# Diagram Builder - 3D Codebase Visualization

> Interactive 3D visualization tool for exploring codebases

## Documentation Locations

When working on this project, key documents are located:

- **Project Overview**: `/README.md` (start here)
- **Architecture**: `/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- **Product Requirements**: `/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
- **Sprint Status**: `/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
- **Current Epic Stories**: `/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/5.5-*.md`
- **Planning Guide**: `/PLANNING.md`

## Context Loading Priority

1. Read `/README.md` for project overview
2. Read `/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (first 100 lines for overview)
3. Read `/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` for current status
4. Read specific story files as needed

# Architecture Decision Document

## Project Overview

**Diagram Builder** is a 3D codebase visualization tool that parses JavaScript/TypeScript codebases and renders them as interactive 3D graphs in the browser.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Parse codebases using Tree-sitter
- Store code graphs in Neo4j
- Render 3D visualizations with Three.js
- Export diagrams in multiple formats
- Collaborate in real-time via WebSockets
- CLI for headless operation

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Neo4j, Redis
- Frontend: React 19, Vite, Three.js, Tailwind CSS
- Parser: Tree-sitter (multi-language support)
- Testing: Vitest, Playwright

**Project Structure:**
```
packages/
  ├── core/           # Shared types and utilities
  ├── parser/         # Tree-sitter code parsing (Epic 3)
  ├── api/            # REST/WebSocket API (Epic 4)
  ├── ui/             # React 3D visualization (Epic 5)
  └── cli/            # Command-line interface (Epic 6 - planned)
```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Epics define major features
2. Stories break epics into implementable units
3. Sprint-status.yaml tracks progress
4. Documentation updates in real-time
