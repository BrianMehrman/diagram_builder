# Story 5.5-8: Sprint Status & Epic Closure

## Story

**ID:** 5.5-8
**Key:** 5.5-8-sprint-status-epic-closure
**Title:** Update sprint-status.yaml and properly close all epics
**Epic:** Epic 5.5 - Foundation Cleanup
**Phase:** Foundation & Quality Gates

**Description:**

Update sprint-status.yaml to accurately reflect ALL completed work, properly close Epics 3, 4, and 5, and create Epic 6 prerequisite checklist. This ensures documentation reflects reality and prevents future drift.

This is the final story of Epic 5.5 and depends on all other stories being complete.

## Dev Notes

### Context from Retrospective

**Documentation Drift Issues:**
- Sprint-status not updated in real-time
- Epic 4 shows "in-progress" but all stories done
- Epic 5 shows "in-progress" with 14/15 done
- No epic closure process
- Definition of done incomplete

### Critical Updates Needed

**Sprint-Status Changes:**
```yaml
# Before (incorrect):
epic-4: in-progress
epic-5: in-progress

# After (correct):
epic-4: done
epic-5: done
epic-5.5: done
```

**Missing Status Markers:**
- Epic retrospectives should be tracked
- Epic completion criteria should be explicit
- Story completion should update immediately

### Implementation Guidance

**Epic Closure Checklist:**
```markdown
# Epic Closure Checklist

```

**Story Completion Checklist:**
```markdown

```

### Critical Constraints

- **Must be accurate** - Sprint-status must reflect reality

- **Must create processes** - Prevent future drift
- **Must get team buy-in** - Processes only work if followed

### Dependencies

- **Depends on:** ALL other Epic 5.5 stories (5.5-1 through 5.5-7)
- **Blocks:** Epic 6 kickoff - validates readiness

### Owner and Estimate

- **Owner:** Bob (Scrum Master)
- **Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
- **Priority:** High
