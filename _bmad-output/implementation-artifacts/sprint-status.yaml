# Notes:
# - Phase 1 (Project Infrastructure): 100% Complete
# - Phase 2 (Core Package): 100% Complete
# - Phase 3 (Parser Package): 100% Complete
# - Phase 4 (API Package): 100% Complete
# - Phase 5 (UI Package): 100% Complete
# - Phase 5.5 (Foundation Cleanup): 80% Complete (8/10 stories done, 2 stories in-progress: 5.5-9, 5.5-10)
# - Phase 6 (Fix Parser & Complete Core Integration): PLANNED - Epic 6 redefined based on brainstorming session (2026-01-03)
#   - Original Epic 6 "CLI Package" postponed - core feature must work first
#   - Brainstorming revealed: integration layer exists and works, only parser file discovery broken
#   - 6 stories defined to fix parser, add observability, improve UX, testing, security, and management UI
